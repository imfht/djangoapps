Reporting an error? It's helpful to know:

* Anymail version
* ESP (Mailgun, SendGrid, etc.)
* Your ANYMAIL settings (change secrets to "redacted")
* Versions of Django, requests, python
* Exact error message and/or stack trace
* Any other relevant code and settings (e.g., for problems
  sending, your code that sends the message)
