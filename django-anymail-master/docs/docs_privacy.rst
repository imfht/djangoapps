Anymail documentation privacy
=============================

Anymail's documentation site at `anymail.readthedocs.io`_ is hosted by
**Read the Docs**. Please see the `Read the Docs Privacy Policy`_ for more
about what information Read the Docs collects and how they use it.

Separately, Anymail's maintainers have configured **Google Analytics**
third-party tracking on this documentation site. We (Anymail's maintainers)
use this analytics data to better understand how these docs are used, for
the purpose of improving the content. Google Analytics helps us answer
questions like:

* what docs pages are most and least viewed
* what terms people search for in the documentation
* what paths readers (in general) tend to take through the docs

But we're *not* able to identify any particular person or track individual
behavior. Anymail's maintainers *do not* collect or have access to any
personally identifiable (or even *potentially* personally identifiable)
information about visitors to this documentation site.

We also use Google Analytics to collect feedback from the "Is this page helpful?"
box at the bottom of the page. Please do not include any personally-identifiable
information in suggestions you submit through this form.
(If you would like to contact Anymail's maintainers, see :ref:`contact`.)

Anymail's maintainers have *not* connected our Google Analytics implementation
to any Google Advertising Services. (Incidentally, we're not involved with the
ads you may see here. Those come from---and support---Read the Docs under
their `ethical ads`_ model.)

The developer audience for Anymail's docs is likely already familiar
with site analytics, tracking cookies, and related concepts. To learn more
about how Google Analytics uses **cookies** and how to **opt out** of
analytics tracking, see the "Information for Visitors of Sites and Apps Using
Google Analytics" section of Google's `Safeguarding your data`_ document.

Questions about privacy and information practices related to this Anymail
documentation site can be emailed to *privacy\<at>anymail\<dot>info*.
(This is not an appropriate contact for questions about *using* Anymail;
see :ref:`help` if you need assistance with your code.)
